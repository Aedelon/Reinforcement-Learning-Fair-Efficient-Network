# Fair Efficient Network

Work based on this article: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.14472.pdf

Here, you will find the files we use for our work about FEN.

They are based on file accessible in https://github.com/PKU-AI-Edge/FEN

These files have been modified to be easier to use for other tests and they are following the paper. Indeed, the original source codes were sometimes different than what we found in the paper.

Currently, we have upload just Job Scheduling.

The easy-to-use files are:

* job_w_hierarchy.py
* job_wo_hierarchy.py

Files about Matthew's Effect & Manufacturing Plant will be released **Soon(TM)**
